# Self-development
This is the begin of my Journey into my second degree "Electronic and communications Engineering".
From this point i'll uplaod all the Pyhton an C projects.
The aim is to achieve the necessary skills to create a project (from the board design and creation to software development).
All the actions in this repository are done via git from VSCode. It's another way to learn github environment.
